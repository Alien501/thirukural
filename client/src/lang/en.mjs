The text consists of 1,330 couplets (kurals), grouped into 133 chapters, each containing ten kurals. Thirukkural is part of the Eighteen Lesser Texts (Pathinenkeezhkanakku) in Sangam literature classification. Essentially, it is a guide for living, explaining fundamental virtues needed for individuals to live harmoniously in their personal lives and to lead a contented and prosperous life in their social lives. The work is divided and intricately woven into three major sections: Virtue (Aram), Wealth (Porul), and Love (Inbam or Kamam), collectively known as Muppaal.Thirukkural addresses all aspects of life, and thus, it is honored with several names: Thirukkural, Muppaal, Uttara Veda, Divine Text, Common Creed, Infallible Word, Speech of Blessing, Tamil Creed, and Thiruvalluvarâ€™s Work. Because it conveys timeless ideas that transcend race, language, and gender, it is also referred to as the "Universal Common Creed. Many have written commentaries on Thirukkural.
